I will be documenting my progress on this Homework Assignment from start to finish. It is imperative that I accurately depict every thought processes that I encure, so that myself and others can understand what I intend. I'm currently trying to learn how to write a markdown file. It will be very useful in the future so I can be capable of implementing easy-to-read markdown for my fellow developers. I will provide links to resources that I harnessed valuable information from, below. For now, I have initialized my project via gitBash and will start with the mark up. I was thinking of a smooth, easy-to-read, bubbly-ish, kind of website. I will iron out the details once I get to it. For now I want to think carefully about how I set up my `<div>` and `container` elements. Given that I intend on utilizing as much CSS as I can, I want to tactical in that aspect. I want to have 3 or 4 links or navbar items. Something like this
````HTML
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">HOME</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">ABOUT ME</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">PROJECTS</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">CONTACT</a></li>
    </ul>
```` 
I also want to have a unique background. Simple colors, but pleasing to look at. Okay.
