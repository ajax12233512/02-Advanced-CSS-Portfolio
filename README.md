# Important notes
This client-side website that is hosted on Github Pages will be the official Web Developer Portfolio for Neil Juanillo (myself).
The purpose of this repo is for employers and the like to have a quick, one-stop-place, to assess my individual competence in the field of programming. 
This Portfolio site consist of 1 page with 4 sections. I encourage potential employers to look into the __Projects__ tab, for it contains my up-to-date work that I'd be happy for anyone to look at.
I also encourage some to look into the __Contact__ section of my website to quickly get my email and phone #.
